<!--
<form> tag is used to create a form. Inside these tags, you'll place various form controls like text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, and buttons for submitting the form.

The <input> tag is commonly used to create form controls. The attributes of this tag define the control's behavior.

The "type" attribute specifies the type of input control (e.g., text, password, checkbox).

The "name" attribute is used for identifying the control, especially when the data is sent to the server. If name is same then only one can be selected.

The "value" attribute sets a default value for the control, which the user can overwrite.
