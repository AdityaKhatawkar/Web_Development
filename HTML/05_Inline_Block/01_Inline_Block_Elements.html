<!--
Inline elements:
Inline Elements don't start on a new line. It only takes the width required to cover the content.

Block elements: 
No matter what the width is, block elements will always start on a new line and take up the full available width of their container by default. This means they essentially claim all the horizontal space for themselves, pushing any content that comes after them to a new line.
