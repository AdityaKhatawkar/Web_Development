<!--
The <meta> tags in HTML provide metadata about the HTML document.
Metadata is data (information) about data.
<meta> tags always go inside the document's <head> tag and are typically used to specify the character set,
page description, keywords, author, and other metadata.


Explanation of each meta tag:

Character Encoding (charset): <meta charset="UTF-8"> sets the character encoding for the webpage.
UTF-8 is the most common and recommended.

Viewport: <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> sets the viewport 
to scale the page to the screen width, useful for responsive design.

IE Compatibility: <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge"> specifies that the page 
should be rendered using the latest rendering engine available on Internet Explorer.

Description: <meta name="description" content="This is a description of the web page"> provides 
a brief description of the webpage, which search engines may use in search results.

Keywords: <meta name="keywords" content="HTML, CSS, JavaScript"> specifies keywords for the webpage, 
which were historically used by search engines but are less relevant today.

Author: <meta name="author" content="Your Name"> indicates the name of the author of the webpage.
