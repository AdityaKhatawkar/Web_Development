HTML Tags

HTML tags are the markers that define the start and end of an element. 
They are wrapped in angle brackets, like <p> and </p>.

HTML Elements
An HTML element includes an opening tag, content, and a closing tag, forming a 
complete set. For example, <p>This is a paragraph.</p>.


ID Attribute

The ID attribute is used to assign a unique identifier to an HTML element. Each element with an ID has its own unique identity, 
similar to how each individual has a unique identity. Multiple elements cannot have the same ID.
Example:
  <p id="html">This is an HTML tutorial</p>
  <p id="python">This is a Python tutorial</p>


Class Attribute

The class attribute is used to associate an HTML element with a particular class, typically for styling or JavaScript
 manipulation. Unlike the ID attribute, the class attribute is not unique, and multiple elements can share the same class.


Inline elements:
Inline elements do not start on a new line and only take up as much width as necessary. They are part of the flow within 
other elements.
Inline elements can contain other inline elements, but they generally should not contain block-level elements. 
For example, you could nest a <strong> (strong emphasis) element within a <span> (a generic inline container) element
Common Inline Elements

    <span>: A generic inline container for text
    <a>: Defines a hyperlink
    <strong>: Defines important text
    <em>: Defines emphasized text
    <img>: Embeds an image
    <input>: Defines an input control
