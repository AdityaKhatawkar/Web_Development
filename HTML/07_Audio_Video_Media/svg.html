SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics. Unlike raster images like PNGs or JPGs, SVGs are not pixel-based. 
They're composed of vectorsâ€”mathematical formulas that describe shapes, paths, and fills. This means SVGs 
can be resized without losing quality.

SVGs can be styled, animated, and manipulated using CSS and JavaScript.

SVG can be embedded in HTML in several ways:
Inline SVG: Directly writing the SVG XML code within HTML.
Using an <img> tag: Point the src attribute to an SVG file.

cirle tag is used to draw a circle.

cx,cy : x and y coordinate to align the image.
r : radius of the circle.
stroke : outline color of the image.
stroke-width : outline thickness.
fill : color to fill the image with.
