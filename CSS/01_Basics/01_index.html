<!-- 
CSS is used for styling the website, we can write it within the html file 
itself or make it a seperate file. 

CSS follows a rule-based structure. Each rule consists of a selector and a declaration block. Selectors pick the HTML elements, 
while declaration blocks contain pairs of properties and values.

Style tag is used when using css within the html file itself.

The general syntax for writing CSS:

selector {
    property: value;
}


example: 
    h1{
        color: red;
        background-color: black;
    }
