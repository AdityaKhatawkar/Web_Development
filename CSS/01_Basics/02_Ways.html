<!-- 
There are 3 ways to add css to a html file:

1) Inline CSS:  Insert the "style" attribute within the HTML element's opening tag.

2) Internal CSS: Internal CSS is defined in a style block, which will be inside the head section.

3) External CSS: Instead of adding the styles within the HTML file, we create a separate file with .css extension.
This file will hold all the styling details. Then, we link this file to the HTML page, giving it the instructions on how to look. 


There is a new <link> tag in the head section, and this link tag has rel and href properties.

The following points will explain each keyword's meaning: 

<link>: This tag is used to create links between different resources, like stylesheets, fonts, and more. In our case, we are using a link tag to 
link the CSS file with the HTML file.

rel="stylesheet": rel stands for relationship,  this defines the type of relationship between the HTML document and the linked resource. When set to "stylesheet", 
it specifies that the linked resource is a stylesheet that will be used to style the HTML content.

href="style.css" : The href attribute stands for "hypertext reference." It specifies the path or URL to the external resource we want to link.
In this case, it's the path to the external CSS file called "style.css".
